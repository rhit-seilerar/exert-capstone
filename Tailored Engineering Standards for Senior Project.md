#### ii.
#### iii.
## 4. Relate the architecture to design.
### a. Identify software system elements that relate to architectural entities and the nature of these relationships.
#### i. f
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as it requires the actual design to be complete. XP would have "an evolutionary design process that lasts as long as the system lasts.(Chapter 1)
#### iii. We have reworked our code designs based on refactoring existing code, such as the exert.py file.
### b. Define the interfaces and interactions among the software system elements and external entities.
#### i. e
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as these definitions are constantly changing beyond what this standard's notes imply (which suggests refinement over redesigning).
#### iii. We have done this during weekly cycles when creating tasks.
### c. Partition, align and allocate requirements to architectural entities and system elements.
#### i. c
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as it needs to be done constantly and not at a single point in time.
#### iii. We have done this semiweekly during our tasks when restructuring our project.
### d. Map software system elements and architectural entities to design characteristics.
#### i. e
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as this will need to be done regularly and not at a single stage as the wording in the original ABET Standard implies.
#### iii. We have actually designed our project around the software system elements instead of mapping system elements to design characteristics.
### e. Define principles for the software system design and evolution.
#### i. b
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as principles and other requirements for a project are constantly changing and should not be treated as static guidelines.
#### iii. We use existing software and research papers in order to see which principles we needed to take into consideration.
## 5. Assess architecture candidates.
### a. Assess each candidate architecture against constraints and requirements.
#### i. g
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as there should only be one architecture to consider, unless if it's an incremental deployment where there's a parallel environment for testing.
#### iii. We have done this when redesigning our singular architecture to reflect our client needs for programs that can run out of the docker.
### b. Assess each candidate architecture against stakeholder concerns using evaluation criteria.
#### i. g
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as there should be only one candidate architecture to consider in the first place using the evaluation criteria.
#### iii. We had a single architecture that was changed based on client feedback.
### c. Select the preferred architecture(s) and capture key decisions and rationale.
#### i. h
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, there should only be one architecture for the project, not several.
#### iii. We only had a single architecture that we had revised based on client feedback and changing requirements and new key decisions.
### d. Establish the architecture baseline of the selected architecture.
#### i. d
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as the architecture could change drastically after the baseline is established, and the baseline may need to be changed.
#### iii. We have not done this, we have changed our baseline multiple times to fit the scope of our tasks.
## 6. Assess architecture candidates.
### a. Formalize the architecture governance approach and specify governance‐related roles and responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities related to design, quality, security, and safety.
#### i. d
#### ii. This is done when negotiating a scope contract, "Write contracts for software development that fix time, costs, and quality but call for an ongoing negotiation of the precise scope of the system. Reduce risk by signing a sequence of short contracts instead of one long one." (Chapter 9)
#### iii. We have done this during client meetings when requesting copyrighted material and access to classified files.
### b. Obtain explicit acceptance of the architecture by stakeholders.
#### i. i
#### ii. XP says to obtain acceptance by allowing stakeholders to be active in developing the architecture. "Generally, the closer customer needs and development capabilities are, the more valuable development becomes." (Chapter 9)
#### iii. We demonstrate our current solutions to the client in weekly meetings so they can provide feedback.
### c. Maintain concordance and completeness of the architectural entities and their architectural characteristics.
#### i. h
#### ii. This is not XP compliant as architectural entities are never completed until the lifespan of the system is complete.
#### iii. We have not been able to apply this to our project.
### d. Organize, assess and control evolution of the architecture models and views to help ensure that the architectural intent is met and the architectural vision and key concepts are correctly implemented.
#### i. e
#### ii. XP says to have a reliance on "oral communication, tests, and source code to communicate system structure and intent." in order to organize and assess the architecture models based on intent. (Chapter 1)
#### iii. We do this during weekly meetings and weekly work sessions, as we evaluate our code during our sessions.
### e. Maintain the architecture definition and evaluation strategy.
#### i. b
#### ii. XP says to use an incremental design, which it defines as "an overall plan that is expected to evolve through the life of the project." (Chapter 1)
#### iii. We have done this when defining our tasks, by revising our system to meet what the client wants for the week.
### f. Maintain traceability of the architecture.
#### i. k
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as documentation is not beneficial in many cases, as Beck said once here, "Extensive internal documentation of software is an example of a practice that violates mutual benefit." (Chapter 5)
#### iii. We have not implemented architecture traceability in our project.
### g. Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.
#### i. j
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as any artifacts and documentation must be generated from the code itself.
#### iii. We have not implemented this, we have generated most of the artifacts and documentation from the code itself. Project task details provide a little more context, but for the most part the code is the documentation we need.
