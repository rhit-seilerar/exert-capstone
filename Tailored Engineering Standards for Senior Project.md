# 6.4.2 Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process
## 1. Prepare for Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
### a. Identify the stakeholders who have an interest in the software system throughout its lifecycle.
#### i. a
#### ii. In XP, the key stakeholder is identified as the customer, as shown with "In XP you only do what you need to do to create value for the customer." The customer is ideally physically present in the building to provide their perspectives on the project, as shown with "Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team." The person in the previous quote is identified as the customer, which indicates that customers in XP share a close definition with stakeholders.
#### iii. Our project team includes Dr. Zachary Estrada and Luke Craig. Though they can not be phsyically present, they are the ones that requested this program and will hopefully propagate it's use with other interested parties.
### b. Define the stakeholder needs and requirements definition strategy.
#### i. d
#### ii. In Extreme Programming, customer needs and requirements are defined in stories created through constant interaction. You write stories according to a quarterly theme, the stories are both written and chosen based on customer feedback and requests, as shown with the quote "Within a release, XP uses one-week iterations of customer-requested features to create fine-grained feedback about progress."
#### iii. The user defined functionality is very broad for our project, so we have had one large story we've been working on over the course of the quarter. Even still, every week we've been creating tasks and confirming them with our clients to make sure that we are making progress towards their desired functionality.
### c. Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support stakeholder needs and requirements definition.
#### i. h
#### ii. Extreme Programming encourages the use of physical space and customer proximity as enabling systems. This is shown with the quotes "Many teams implement this practice in part by putting story cards on a wall," which is done to increase visibility, and "Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team."
#### iii. We have been doing weekly meetings with our clients, but we are required to work remotely with virtual stories because of space constraints. Even still, our system has been working.
### d. Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used.
#### i. h
#### ii. Extreme Programming doesn't specifically explain how to do this. Extreme programming doesn't give specific advice on how to access necessary systems or services, rather it outlines values, principles, and practices that can be followed to improve your programming performance.
#### iii. Our team is outlining tasks that contain the user needs and requirements using a GitHub project, as we all agreed in class.
## 2. Define stakeholder needs.
### a. Define context of use within the concept of operations and the preliminary life cycle concepts.
#### i. b
#### ii. As previously noted, Extreme Programming advocates for the establishment of all necessary user information through direct customer involvement with meetings, as shown with "Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team."
#### iii. Our clients are involved with our weekly meetings to make sure that we are creating a project that fits correctly within the context they are planning to use it.
### b. Identify stakeholder needs.
#### i. d
#### ii. As previously stated, customer needs are gathered through direct weekly feedback and by having the customer have a voice in selecting the weekly stories that the team is working on, as shown with "Within a release, XP uses one-week iterations of customer-requested features to create fine-grained feedback about progress."
#### iii. We have weekly meetings with our clients to create tasks and establish our clients' needs, as well as making sure our existing work is successfully moving towards fulfilling our clients goals.
### c. Prioritize and down-select needs.
#### i. e
#### ii. The customer in Extreme Programming chooses which needs to prioritize, as shown by "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
#### iii. As previously mentioned, we have discussions with the clients every week to determine which tasks are the most pressing and should be prioritized.
### d. Define the stakeholder needs and rationale.
#### i. d
#### ii. Extreme programming advocates for these to be formalized using tasks and stories that are created weekly. This is known because stories are defined as "units of customer-visible functionality," which closely fits to needs and requirements.
#### iii. As noted many times, we create tasks every week during our meetings with our clients which capture our clients' needs.
## 3. Develop the operational concept and other life cycle concepts. 
### a. Define a representative set of scenarios to identify the required capabilities that correspond to anticipated operational and other life cycle concepts.
#### i. b
#### ii. This conflicts with the idea of incremental design. The Extreme Programming textbook states "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far," which implies that we should only consider use scenarios when we're about to implement their functionality.
#### iii. We have been spending most of this term setting up essential backend functionality, but generally we are considering the ways that our clients will be using our software and their context of use when we're developing that functionality, consistent with Extreme Programming.
### b. Identify the factors affecting interactions between users and the system.
#### i. Anticipated physical, mental, and learned capabilities of the users;
##### A. b
##### B. According to Extreme Programming, the principles of incremental development and of weekly cycles combine to indicate that interactions between the system and the user should only be considered when implementing relevant functionality, as established during the weekly meeting when tasks and stories are established. The supporting quotes for this are "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far" and "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
##### C. Our clients are college educated programmers, so we are certain that they will be able to use our CLI interface, especially with the help text that we've implemented for the commands.
#### ii. Workplace, environment and facilities, including other equipment in the context of use;
##### A. b
##### B. According to Extreme Programming, the principles of incremental development and of weekly cycles combine to indicate that interactions between the system and the user should only be considered when implementing relevant functionality, as established during the weekly meeting when tasks and stories are established. The supporting quotes for this are "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far" and "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
##### C. The only environmental factor that we have so far considered is which operating system the client is running. As long as the dependencies are installed (Python and Docker), the program runs on both Windows and Linux.
#### iii. Normal, unusual, and emergency conditions; and
##### A. b
##### B. According to Extreme Programming, the principles of incremental development and of weekly cycles combine to indicate that interactions between the system and the user should only be considered when implementing relevant functionality, as established during the weekly meeting when tasks and stories are established. The supporting quotes for this are "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far" and "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
##### C. We have not yet considered the system operating under emergency or unusual conditions. This is most likely not applicable, but further discussion with our clients may eventually show otherwise.
#### iv. Operator and user recruitment, training and culture.
##### A. b
##### B. According to Extreme Programming, the principles of incremental development and of weekly cycles combine to indicate that interactions between the system and the user should only be considered when implementing relevant functionality, as established during the weekly meeting when tasks and stories are established. The supporting quotes for this are "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far" and "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
##### C. Our current running assumption is that any new users of our program will be similar in education and ability to our existing users, but will correct if this assumption is incorrect.
## 4. Transform stakeholder needs into stakeholder requirements.
### a. Identify the constraints on a system solution.
#### i. c
#### ii. Constraints are a form of design decision, which following incremental design should be determined at the beginning of the current week of development, as shown by the quote "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far."
#### iii. Our clients have had a number of constraints, which they have specified each week before we began work on tasks or as feedback to the previous week of work. A great example is the constraint that our generator for ramdisks should be able to run as nonroot, which they specified as feedback after we developed the first version of the ramdisk.
### b. Identify the stakeholder requirements and functions that relate to critical quality characteristics, such as assurance, safety, security, environment, or health.
#### i. e
#### ii. This is solicited immediately during the first meeting and maintained in subsequent meetings, as shown with "While compatible with XP, these practices have to be incorporated into the team's daily work. For example, refactorings have to preserve the security of the system as well as its functionality."
#### iii. Our client hasn't had many hard requirements for critical quality characteristics, though there is an implicit suggestion that it should run in a reasonable amount of time, so our project thus far runs with good performance.
### c. Define stakeholder requirements, consistent with life cycle concepts, scenarios, interactions, constraints, and critical quality characteristics.
#### i. e
#### ii. Stakeholder requirements are included with stories, which as previously established are part of a weekly cycle of adding new functionality. Following the above requirements is implied by Extreme Programming, for example with "In XP you only do what you need to do to create value for the customer," and all of this work is done with direct customer feedback and consent.
#### iii. We have had in-depth conversations with our clients every week on the tasks we're completing and the way that our client would like to see them implemented, specifically so that we stay within any constraints they have in mind and create a product that meets their desires successfully.
## 5. Analyze stakeholder requirements.
### a. Analyze the complete set of stakeholder requirements.
#### i. e
#### ii. This is specifically against incremental design, which states "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far." Thus, we should only analyze all of the requirements at the very end of the project, when they've all been implemented.
#### iii. Because this contradicts Extreme Programming, we haven't done it.
### b. Define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement.
#### i. f
#### ii. In Extreme Programming, peformance concerns should be a part of customer feedback, as shown with "Feedback is a critical part of communication. 'Is performance going to be a problem?' 'I don't know. Let's write a little performance prototype and see.'"
#### iii. Our implementation thus far has worked with good enough performance that our client hasn't been concerned, so we haven't had to do specific measurements or try to specifically make performance improvements, at least so far.
### c. Feed back the analyzed requirements to applicable stakeholders to validate that their needs and expectations have been adequately captured and expressed.
#### i. g
#### ii. Extreme Programming believes in constant customer involvement and feedback, which inherently includes this criteria. For example, the quote "Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team. Visionary customers can be part of quarterly and weekly planning."
#### iii. Our clients have had our project demonstrated to them during our weekly meetings and have full access to our current work, and we have received constant feedback from them over the course of the term.
### d. Resolve stakeholder requirements issues.
#### i. g
#### ii. Extreme Programming requires customer consent for choosing tasks and creating stories, so these issues are almost always very small and fixed with feedback the week after. This is shown in part with the quote "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
#### iii. We have encountered only very small issues because of our heavy client involvement and have been able to fix all of their issues in the following week.
## 6. Manage the stakeholder needs and requirements definition.
### a. Obtain explicit agreement with designated stakeholders on the stakeholder requirements.
#### i. g
#### ii. Extrme Programming states that all stories should be written either by the customers or with their explicit consent, as shown with the quote "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
#### iii. Every week we have explained all of our current work and tasks to our clients and received their feedback and consent to continue, making adjustments and changing tasks whenever as they request.
### b. Maintain traceability of stakeholder needs and requirements.
#### i. i
#### ii. Traceability is not a value that guides XP, though they said it may be applicable to your project. The quote specifically is "If you work in safety-critical systems, the principle of traceability is important for gaining certification for your systems. Because it is not applicable to all software, I did not include it in this list. Other principles may guide your team's practices, but these are the principles that guide XP."
#### iii. Because traceability isn't an XP principle, we have not placed any emphasis on it.
### c. Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.
#### i. g
#### ii. Extreme Programming advocates for no permanent artifacts except the code and tests, as shown with "Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts." Even still, the customers should have access to the product and should be able to offer feedback based on the current functionality.
#### iii. We have provided our clients with access to our repository and our program so that they can evaluate its current status.

# 6.4.4 Architecture Definition process
## 1. Prepare for architecture definition.
### a. Review pertinent information and identify key drivers of the architecture.
#### i. d                                                                                   
#### ii. "Have the customers pick a week’s worth of stories to implement this week." (Stories)
#### iii. Our client communicates his key requirements for the week at the virtual meeting each Monday.
### b. Identify stakeholder concerns.
#### i. a
#### ii. "Have the customers pick a week’s worth of stories to implement this week." (Stories, again)
#### iii. See above.
### c. Define the Architecture Definition roadmap, approach, and strategy.
#### i. d
#### ii. "Strive to make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day." (Incremental Design)
#### iii. Our group meets the day after the week's client meeting to make a more granular plan for the week's changes.
### d. Define architecture evaluation criteria based on stakeholder concerns and key requirements.
#### i.  e
#### ii. "Design done close to when it is used is more efficient." (Incremental Design, again)
#### iii. For the rest of the week following the client meeting, our team will redesign sections of our codebase to better meet the needs of the current week's tasks.
### e. Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support the Architecture Definition process.
#### i. j
#### ii. N/A - not mentioned in XP.
#### iii. At our first client meeting, we were informed that we would be building our project off of the PANDA system, and began researching it accordingly.
### f. Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used.
#### i. j
#### ii. N/A - not mentioned in XP.  
#### iii. We spent the first week obtaining access to, and setting up, the PANDA system upon which our project is built.
## 2. Develop architecture viewpoints.
### a. Select, adapt, or develop viewpoints and model kinds based on stakeholder concerns.
#### i.  b
#### ii. "Have the customers pick a week’s worth of stories to implement this week." (Weekly Cycle)
#### iii. We worked to implement the client's needs as they were specified to us.
### b. Establish or identify potential architecture framework(s) to be used in developing models and views.
#### i. d
#### ii. N/A - not mentioned in XP
#### iii. We spent several weeks setting up and employing tools to build a filesystem for our project.
### c. Capture rationale for selection of framework(s), viewpoints and model kinds.
#### i. b
#### ii. N/A - not mentioned in XP
#### iii. We set up and built tools as needed in response to project requirements, namely the need to create filesystems and validate ISO files.
### d. Select or develop supporting modelling techniques and tools.
#### i. d
#### ii. N/A - not mentioned in XP
#### iii. We spent several weeks setting up and employing tools to build a filesystem for our project.
## 3. Develop models and views of candidate architectures.
### a. Define the software system context and boundaries in terms of interfaces and interactions with external entities.
#### i.  c
#### ii. "Design done close to when it is used is more efficient." (Incremental Design)
#### iii. Our software needs to interface with PANDA to achieve design goals; much of our first few weeks were spent determining how to effectively do so.
### b. Identify architectural entities and relationships between entities that address key stakeholder concerns and critical software system requirements.
#### i. k
#### ii. "Break the stories into tasks. Team members sign up for tasks and estimate them." (Stories)
#### iii. During estimation, the individual components of each task (whether prerequisite scaffolding, additional classes/methods, or external tools required to implement the task) are determined and written into the notes for that specific task.
### c. Allocate concepts, properties, characteristics, behaviors, functions, or constraints that are significant to architecture decisions of the software system to architectural entities.
#### i. e
#### ii. "Break the stories into tasks. Team members sign up for tasks and estimate them." (Stories, again)
#### iii. Deconstruction of individual subtasks is accomplished as described above.
### d. Select, adapt, or develop models of the candidate architectures of the software system.
#### i. g
#### ii. N/A - not mentioned in XP.
#### iii. We design and build our software to meet the specifications of the week.
### e. Compose views from the models in accordance with identified viewpoints to express how the architecture addresses stakeholder concerns and meets stakeholder and system/software requirements.
#### i. k
#### ii. "Have the customers pick a week’s worth of stories to implement this week." (Weekly Cycle)
#### iii. After the client gives us his set of tasks, we build an understanding of what work needs to be done (to include installing prerequiste tooling, if needed) to complete each task and then estimate the time needed to complete them all.
### f. Harmonize the architecture models and views with each other.
#### i. i
#### ii. N/A - not mentioned in XP.
#### iii. We come up with a basic plan for the software in direct accordance with client specifications; because there is only one workflow, harmonization is not necessary.
## 4. Relate the architecture to design.
### a. Identify software system elements that relate to architectural entities and the nature of these relationships.
#### i. f
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as it requires the actual design to be complete. XP would have "an evolutionary design process that lasts as long as the system lasts.(Chapter 1)
#### iii. We have reworked our code designs based on refactoring existing code, such as the exert.py file.
### b. Define the interfaces and interactions among the software system elements and external entities.
#### i. e
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as these definitions are constantly changing beyond what this standard's notes imply (which suggests refinement over redesigning).
#### iii. We have done this during weekly cycles when creating tasks.
### c. Partition, align and allocate requirements to architectural entities and system elements.
#### i. c
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as it needs to be done constantly and not at a single point in time.
#### iii. We have done this semiweekly during our tasks when restructuring our project.
### d. Map software system elements and architectural entities to design characteristics.
#### i. e
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as this will need to be done regularly and not at a single stage as the wording in the original ABET Standard implies.
#### iii. We have actually designed our project around the software system elements instead of mapping system elements to design characteristics.
### e. Define principles for the software system design and evolution.
#### i. b
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as principles and other requirements for a project are constantly changing and should not be treated as static guidelines.
#### iii. We use existing software and research papers in order to see which principles we needed to take into consideration.
## 5. Assess architecture candidates.
### a. Assess each candidate architecture against constraints and requirements.
#### i. g
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as there should only be one architecture to consider, unless if it's an incremental deployment where there's a parallel environment for testing.
#### iii. We have done this when redesigning our singular architecture to reflect our client needs for programs that can run out of the docker.
### b. Assess each candidate architecture against stakeholder concerns using evaluation criteria.
#### i. g
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as there should be only one candidate architecture to consider in the first place using the evaluation criteria.
#### iii. We had a single architecture that was changed based on client feedback.
### c. Select the preferred architecture(s) and capture key decisions and rationale.
#### i. h
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, there should only be one architecture for the project, not several.
#### iii. We only had a single architecture that we had revised based on client feedback and changing requirements and new key decisions.
### d. Establish the architecture baseline of the selected architecture.
#### i. d
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as the architecture could change drastically after the baseline is established, and the baseline may need to be changed.
#### iii. We have not done this, we have changed our baseline multiple times to fit the scope of our tasks.
## 6. Assess architecture candidates.
### a. Formalize the architecture governance approach and specify governance‐related roles and responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities related to design, quality, security, and safety.
#### i. d
#### ii. This is done when negotiating a scope contract, "Write contracts for software development that fix time, costs, and quality but call for an ongoing negotiation of the precise scope of the system. Reduce risk by signing a sequence of short contracts instead of one long one." (Chapter 9)
#### iii. We have done this during client meetings when requesting copyrighted material and access to classified files.
### b. Obtain explicit acceptance of the architecture by stakeholders.
#### i. i
#### ii. XP says to obtain acceptance by allowing stakeholders to be active in developing the architecture. "Generally, the closer customer needs and development capabilities are, the more valuable development becomes." (Chapter 9)
#### iii. We demonstrate our current solutions to the client in weekly meetings so they can provide feedback.
### c. Maintain concordance and completeness of the architectural entities and their architectural characteristics.
#### i. h
#### ii. This is not XP compliant as architectural entities are never completed until the lifespan of the system is complete.
#### iii. We have not been able to apply this to our project.
### d. Organize, assess and control evolution of the architecture models and views to help ensure that the architectural intent is met and the architectural vision and key concepts are correctly implemented.
#### i. e
#### ii. XP says to have a reliance on "oral communication, tests, and source code to communicate system structure and intent." in order to organize and assess the architecture models based on intent. (Chapter 1)
#### iii. We do this during weekly meetings and weekly work sessions, as we evaluate our code during our sessions.
### e. Maintain the architecture definition and evaluation strategy.
#### i. b
#### ii. XP says to use an incremental design, which it defines as "an overall plan that is expected to evolve through the life of the project." (Chapter 1)
#### iii. We have done this when defining our tasks, by revising our system to meet what the client wants for the week.
### f. Maintain traceability of the architecture.
#### i. k
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as documentation is not beneficial in many cases, as Beck said once here, "Extensive internal documentation of software is an example of a practice that violates mutual benefit." (Chapter 5)
#### iii. We have not implemented architecture traceability in our project.
### g. Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.
#### i. j
#### ii. This is not XP compliant, as any artifacts and documentation must be generated from the code itself.
#### iii. We have not implemented this, we have generated most of the artifacts and documentation from the code itself. Project task details provide a little more context, but for the most part the code is the documentation we need.

# 6.4.5 Design Definition process

## 1. Prepare for software system design definition.

### a. Define the design definition strategy, consistent with the selected life cycle model and anticipated design artifacts.
#### i. c
#### ii. XP defines the design strategy as incremental design with quarterly cycles to review. There are no anticipated design artifacts because XP states to "maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts."
#### iii. We use XP's practice here. For example, after each weekly client meeting, we plan for the design and work of the next week.

### b. Select and prioritize design principles and design characteristics.
#### i. a
#### ii. XP states to "have the customers pick a week's worth of stories" every week, deferring the selection and prioritization to them.
#### iii. We select tasks weekly and discuss their priority with our client.

### c. Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support design definition.
#### i. c
#### ii. XP doesn't mention enabling systems. However, in the case that you can't design without access to some design-enabling system, XP suggests to work on what you can by "[striving] to make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day." Do what you can, and then fix the rest once you get access.
#### iii. We haven't had any need for design definition-enabling systems yet.

### d. Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used.
#### i. g
#### ii. XP doesn't mention enabling systems. However, XP does suggest to "include on the team people with all the skills and perspectives necessary for the team to succeed," so you might be able to ask a team member for access.
#### iii. We haven't had any need for design definition-enabling systems yet.

## 2. Establish designs related to each software system element.

### a. Transform architectural and design characteristics into the design of software system elements.
#### i. a
#### ii. XP states to "make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day," so the design is automatically based on architectural and requirement constraints.
#### iii. Due to the nature of our project, we automatically consider architectural requirements while we design. For example, the design of the plugin is highly dependent on the architectures we support, since they control how we access the needed data.

### b. Define and prepare or obtain the necessary design enablers.
#### i. g
#### ii. XP doesn't mention design enablers. However, XP states to "make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day," so you should obtain the necessary design enablers as needed on the day of.
#### iii. We obtain required dependencies as part of our tasks. For example, we only downloaded our busybox dependency once we actually needed to use it.

### c. Examine design alternatives and feasibility of implementation.
#### i. e
#### ii. XP states to "make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day," so there shouldn't be any design alternatives-- simply designs.
#### iii. Because our system is highly dependent on the client's domain-specific knowledge, when attempted approaches don't pan out, we bring a number of options and their feasibilities to the client for discussion.

### d. Refine or define the interfaces among the software system elements and with external entities.
#### i. d
#### ii. XP states to "make the design of the system an excellent fit for the needs of the system that day" and to "identify bottlenecks, especially those controlled outside the team" quarterly. So, interfaces should be designed and refined as needed day-to-day, and if they're posing a problem, repaired at the end of a quarter.
#### iii. In order to facilitate the distribution of tasks, we split our system into components early into the project. The interface with external entities, however, is refined daily.

### e. Establish the design artifacts.
#### i. f
#### ii. N/A. XP states to "maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts," so design artifacts are incompatible with XP.
#### iii. We don't have any design artifacts.

## 3. Assess alternatives for obtaining software system elements.

### a. Determine technologies required for each element composing the software system.
#### i. b
#### ii. XP designs incrementally, determining required technologies as needed, planning to "initiate repairs" as needed during quarterly meetings. 
#### iii. We do this during our weekly meetings with the client, to make use of their domain-specific knowledge and preferences. For example, we determined the need for fakeroot when discussing the usermode component with the client.

### b. Identify candidate alternatives for the software system elements.
#### i. e
#### ii. XP states to "invest in the design of the system every day" to make it an "excellent fit for the needs of the system that day," so you should identify candidate alternatives only as necessary.
#### iii. We similarly discuss these when determining required technologies. Following the same example as above, cpio and dimitri were discussed alternatives.

### c. Assess each candidate alternative against criteria developed from expected design characteristics and element requirements to determine suitability for the intended application.
#### i. e
#### ii. XP doesn't say much to this regard. Design options must obviously be assessed for viability, all XP has to say is that you should defer these decisions to the "last responsible moment."
#### iii. We have limited time during our client meetings, so we assess listed options during worktime via research and trial-and-error. For example, in order to find the tasklist, we researched and attempted several approaches (stack, fs/gs, symtab) in order to assess their viability.

### d. Choose the preferred alternatives among candidate design solutions for the software system elements.
#### i. e
#### ii. XP attempts to defer design to the "last responsible moment," and to "fit the needs of the system that day." Thus, XP simply chooses the easiest alternative that currently works, and will re-evaluate later if necessary.
#### iii. Because XP practices the use of the simplest possible working product, we just go with the first viable alternative. For example, parsing instructions from memory is a viable option, but it's significantly more complex than the stack option.

## 4. Manage the design.

### a. Capture the design and rationale.
#### i. f
#### ii. N/A. XP states to "maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts," so design artifacts are incompatible with XP.
#### iii. Because design artifacts are incompatible with XP, we don't practice this task. We do, however, discuss our design and rationale with our client weekly.

### b. Establish traceability between the detailed design elements, the system/software requirements, and the architectural entities of the software system architecture.
#### i. h
#### ii. N/A. XP states to "maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts," so design artifacts are incompatible with XP. XP also disagrees with requirements, preferring stories over them because "they [aren't] really mandatory or obligatory".
#### iii. We don't maintain traceability design artifacts. However, we do practice incremental design, so you can use git history to trace changes to tasks.

### c. Determine the status of the software system and element design.
#### i. f
#### ii. XP recommends weekly meetings where you "review progress to date," and that you should "invest in the design of the system every day." XP also recommends quarterly meetings to "identify bottlenecks" and thus check in on the system's overall status. In short, XP says to determine the status of the system quarterly and the status of the element design weekly.
#### iii. We check in on design status weekly, such as in our client meetings and during our task-estimation meetings. We also review the status of our system weekly with the client and adivsor.

### d. Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.
#### i. f
#### ii. N/A. XP states to "maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts," so design artifacts are incompatible with XP.
#### iii. Because design artifacts are incompatible with XP, we don't practice this task.
