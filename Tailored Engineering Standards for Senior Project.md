# 6.4.2 Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process
## 1. Prepare for Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
### a. Identify the stakeholders who have an interest in the software system throughout its lifecycle.
#### i. a
#### ii. In XP, the key stakeholder is identified as the customer, as shown with "In XP you only do what you need to do to create value for the customer." The customer is ideally physically present in the building to provide their perspectives on the project, as shown with "Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team." The person in the previous quote is identified as the customer, which indicates that customers in XP share a close definition with stakeholders.
#### iii. Our project team includes Dr. Zachary Estrada and Luke Craig. Though they can not be phsyically present, they are the ones that requested this program and will hopefully propagate it's use with other interested parties.
### b. Define the stakeholder needs and requirements definition strategy.
#### i. d
#### ii. In Extreme Programming, customer needs and requirements are defined in stories created through constant interaction. You write stories according to a quarterly theme, the stories are both written and chosen based on customer feedback and requests, as shown with the quote "Within a release, XP uses one-week iterations of customer-requested features to create fine-grained feedback about progress."
#### iii. The user defined functionality is very broad for our project, so we have had one large story we've been working on over the course of the quarter. Even still, every week we've been creating tasks and confirming them with our clients to make sure that we are making progress towards their desired functionality.
### c. Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support stakeholder needs and requirements definition.
#### i. h
#### ii. Extreme Programming encourages the use of physical space and customer proximity as enabling systems. This is shown with the quotes "Many teams implement this practice in part by putting story cards on a wall," which is done to increase visibility, and "Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team."
#### iii. We have been doing weekly meetings with our clients, but we are required to work remotely with virtual stories because of space constraints. Even still, our system has been working.
### d. Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used.
#### i. h
#### ii. Extreme Programming doesn't specifically explain how to do this. Extreme programming doesn't give specific advice on how to access necessary systems or services, rather it outlines values, principles, and practices that can be followed to improve your programming performance.
#### iii. Our team is outlining tasks that contain the user needs and requirements using a GitHub project, as we all agreed in class.
## 2. Define stakeholder needs.
### a. Define context of use within the concept of operations and the preliminary life cycle concepts.
#### i. b
#### ii. As previously noted, Extreme Programming advocates for the establishment of all necessary user information through direct customer involvement with meetings, as shown with "Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team."
#### iii. Our clients are involved with our weekly meetings to make sure that we are creating a project that fits correctly within the context they are planning to use it.
### b. Identify stakeholder needs.
#### i. d
#### ii. As previously stated, customer needs are gathered through direct weekly feedback and by having the customer have a voice in selecting the weekly stories that the team is working on, as shown with "Within a release, XP uses one-week iterations of customer-requested features to create fine-grained feedback about progress."
#### iii. We have weekly meetings with our clients to create tasks and establish our clients' needs, as well as making sure our existing work is successfully moving towards fulfilling our clients goals.
### c. Prioritize and down-select needs.
#### i. e
#### ii. The customer in Extreme Programming chooses which needs to prioritize, as shown by "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
#### iii. As previously mentioned, we have discussions with the clients every week to determine which tasks are the most pressing and should be prioritized.
### d. Define the stakeholder needs and rationale.
#### i. d
#### ii. Extreme programming advocates for these to be formalized using tasks and stories that are created weekly. This is known because stories are defined as "units of customer-visible functionality," which closely fits to needs and requirements.
#### iii. As noted many times, we create tasks every week during our meetings with our clients which capture our clients' needs.
## 3. Develop the operational concept and other life cycle concepts. 
### a. Define a representative set of scenarios to identify the required capabilities that correspond to anticipated operational and other life cycle concepts.
#### i. b
#### ii. This conflicts with the idea of incremental design. The Extreme Programming textbook states "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far," which implies that we should only consider use scenarios when we're about to implement their functionality.
#### iii. We have been spending most of this term setting up essential backend functionality, but generally we are considering the ways that our clients will be using our software and their context of use when we're developing that functionality, consistent with Extreme Programming.
### b. Identify the factors affecting interactions between users and the system.
#### i. Anticipated physical, mental, and learned capabilities of the users;
##### A. b
##### B. According to Extreme Programming, the principles of incremental development and of weekly cycles combine to indicate that interactions between the system and the user should only be considered when implementing relevant functionality, as established during the weekly meeting when tasks and stories are established. The supporting quotes for this are "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far" and "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
##### C. Our clients are college educated programmers, so we are certain that they will be able to use our CLI interface, especially with the help text that we've implemented for the commands.
#### ii. Workplace, environment and facilities, including other equipment in the context of use;
##### A. b
##### B. According to Extreme Programming, the principles of incremental development and of weekly cycles combine to indicate that interactions between the system and the user should only be considered when implementing relevant functionality, as established during the weekly meeting when tasks and stories are established. The supporting quotes for this are "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far" and "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
##### C. The only environmental factor that we have so far considered is which operating system the client is running. As long as the dependencies are installed (Python and Docker), the program runs on both Windows and Linux.
#### iii. Normal, unusual, and emergency conditions; and
##### A. b
##### B. According to Extreme Programming, the principles of incremental development and of weekly cycles combine to indicate that interactions between the system and the user should only be considered when implementing relevant functionality, as established during the weekly meeting when tasks and stories are established. The supporting quotes for this are "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far" and "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
##### C. We have not yet considered the system operating under emergency or unusual conditions. This is most likely not applicable, but further discussion with our clients may eventually show otherwise.
#### iv. Operator and user recruitment, training and culture.
##### A. b
##### B. According to Extreme Programming, the principles of incremental development and of weekly cycles combine to indicate that interactions between the system and the user should only be considered when implementing relevant functionality, as established during the weekly meeting when tasks and stories are established. The supporting quotes for this are "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far" and "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
##### C. Our current running assumption is that any new users of our program will be similar in education and ability to our existing users, but will correct if this assumption is incorrect.
## 4. Transform stakeholder needs into stakeholder requirements.
### a. Identify the constraints on a system solution.
#### i. c
#### ii. Constraints are a form of design decision, which following incremental design should be determined at the beginning of the current week of development, as shown by the quote "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far."
#### iii. Our clients have had a number of constraints, which they have specified each week before we began work on tasks or as feedback to the previous week of work. A great example is the constraint that our generator for ramdisks should be able to run as nonroot, which they specified as feedback after we developed the first version of the ramdisk.
### b. Identify the stakeholder requirements and functions that relate to critical quality characteristics, such as assurance, safety, security, environment, or health.
#### i. e
#### ii. This is solicited immediately during the first meeting and maintained in subsequent meetings, as shown with "While compatible with XP, these practices have to be incorporated into the team's daily work. For example, refactorings have to preserve the security of the system as well as its functionality."
#### iii. Our client hasn't had many hard requirements for critical quality characteristics, though there is an implicit suggestion that it should run in a reasonable amount of time, so our project thus far runs with good performance.
### c. Define stakeholder requirements, consistent with life cycle concepts, scenarios, interactions, constraints, and critical quality characteristics.
#### i. e
#### ii. Stakeholder requirements are included with stories, which as previously established are part of a weekly cycle of adding new functionality. Following the above requirements is implied by Extreme Programming, for example with "In XP you only do what you need to do to create value for the customer," and all of this work is done with direct customer feedback and consent.
#### iii. We have had in-depth conversations with our clients every week on the tasks we're completing and the way that our client would like to see them implemented, specifically so that we stay within any constraints they have in mind and create a product that meets their desires successfully.
## 5. Analyze stakeholder requirements.
### a. Analyze the complete set of stakeholder requirements.
#### i. e
#### ii. This is specifically against incremental design, which states "The advice to XP teams is not to minimize design investment over the short run, but to keep the design investment in proportion to the needs of the system so far." Thus, we should only analyze all of the requirements at the very end of the project, when they've all been implemented.
#### iii. Because this contradicts Extreme Programming, we haven't done it.
### b. Define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement.
#### i. f
#### ii. In Extreme Programming, peformance concerns should be a part of customer feedback, as shown with "Feedback is a critical part of communication. 'Is performance going to be a problem?' 'I don't know. Let's write a little performance prototype and see.'"
#### iii. Our implementation thus far has worked with good enough performance that our client hasn't been concerned, so we haven't had to do specific measurements or try to specifically make performance improvements, at least so far.
### c. Feed back the analyzed requirements to applicable stakeholders to validate that their needs and expectations have been adequately captured and expressed.
#### i. g
#### ii. Extreme Programming believes in constant customer involvement and feedback, which inherently includes this criteria. For example, the quote "Make people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team. Visionary customers can be part of quarterly and weekly planning."
#### iii. Our clients have had our project demonstrated to them during our weekly meetings and have full access to our current work, and we have received constant feedback from them over the course of the term.
### d. Resolve stakeholder requirements issues.
#### i. g
#### ii. Extreme Programming requires customer consent for choosing tasks and creating stories, so these issues are almost always very small and fixed with feedback the week after. This is shown in part with the quote "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
#### iii. We have encountered only very small issues because of our heavy client involvement and have been able to fix all of their issues in the following week.
## 6. Manage the stakeholder needs and requirements definition.
### a. Obtain explicit agreement with designated stakeholders on the stakeholder requirements.
#### i. g
#### ii. Extrme Programming states that all stories should be written either by the customers or with their explicit consent, as shown with the quote "Have the customers pick a week's worth of stories to implement this week."
#### iii. Every week we have explained all of our current work and tasks to our clients and received their feedback and consent to continue, making adjustments and changing tasks whenever as they request.
### b. Maintain traceability of stakeholder needs and requirements.
#### i. i
#### ii. Traceability is not a value that guides XP, though they said it may be applicable to your project. The quote specifically is "If you work in safety-critical systems, the principle of traceability is important for gaining certification for your systems. Because it is not applicable to all software, I did not include it in this list. Other principles may guide your team's practices, but these are the principles that guide XP."
#### iii. Because traceability isn't an XP principle, we have not placed any emphasis on it.
### c. Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.
#### i. g
#### ii. Extreme Programming advocates for no permanent artifacts except the code and tests, as shown with "Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts." Even still, the customers should have access to the product and should be able to offer feedback based on the current functionality.
#### iii. We have provided our clients with access to our repository and our program so that they can evaluate its current status.
